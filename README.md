# CO2-Emission-prediction-using-Regression
Due to the continuous increase in pollution and global warming, it becomes necessary to study the CO2 emissions by various vehicles and their new models, in order to keep a check on their ill-effects on the environment. It would be difficult to drive every new model of a vehicle on the road to measure the fuel consumption and also it would be impossible to get accurate results this way because so many factors including road conditions and weather, to name just two – can affect a vehicle’s performance and hence we need some other way to perform the task efficiently. Even though in order to avoid driving every new model of a vehicle, vehicle manufacturers use standard, controlled laboratory testing and analytical procedures to generate the fuel consumption data that appears in the dataset but it would be better if we could just simply create a trained machine learning model with enough accuracy to predict the  emissions from the vehicles, which is exactly going to be the aim of our project.
Methodology:
          Analysis of the dataset and finding co-relations between various variables.
          Dividing the dataset into dependent and independent features.
          Plotting the relations between various parameters and the emission rates.
          Train-Test split using sklearn (70:30).
          Implementing a Linear regression model to make our predictions.
          Accuracy calculations.
